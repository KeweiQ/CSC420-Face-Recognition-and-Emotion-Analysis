## Introduction & Member Intro

## The Problem
### Facial Expression Analysis
- Analysis facial expressions and connect them to known emotional states
- Enable the capability with any image with a face contained

### Overall Goal
- Read Slides

## Previous Accomplishments
- Read slides or
- Refer to project proposal

## Our Algorithm
Inspired by and modified from Eigenfaces
- Use the model to predict facial expressions instead of faces

### (Added) Viola-Jones Object Detection Framework
- To enable "versatility": capability to work on general photos
- Paul Viola and Micharl Jones, 2001
- Haar-like Features, Cascaded Classifier
- Read slides

### (Replaced) Fisherfaces
- A combination of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
- Finds a linear combination of features with the consideration of classes, so discriminative information will not be lost

### Multi-layer Preception Neural Network
- Early-stopping training: stops when the change of accuracy in the validation set between epochs is not seeing significant change, so as to prevent overfitting

## Proposed Experiments
### Capability Justification

### Modification Test
